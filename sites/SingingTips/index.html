	What makes a good singer scientifically is their vocal cords, vocal range, pitch, the strength of their voice, breathing technique, ability to sing in tune, age, gender, genetics, and the size of their mouth.
	Top 10 sining tips



	1. Breathe; Help your voice vibrate
		- without air, you have no voice
	2. Let your voice crack; break through the barriers
		- know where your voice cracks, fix it 
	3. Don't sing the whole sentance; Sing each sound
		- remember that when your sing, you have a whole string of sounds that make up a whole sentance
		- it's easy to focus on the best parts of the lyrics but lack on emphasising on the subtle parts which matters just as much
	4. Shape your mouth; Let your sound release itself
		- your sining voice is an instrument and must be treated as such
		- thinking brass intrustments, the outputs are all shaped certain ways to produce their sounds, your mouth is no different 
	5. Pretend to sing; Don't stress about perfecting your voice
	6. Imagine your the sound of your voice
		- 
	7. Drink water; Give your vocal chords a grip
		- Drinking water immediatley enhances your skills
	8. lets your nasaly voice lead the way
		- you may not hear it at first, but your nasaly voice is what holds your voice together
	9. Use the consonantes of the word to sing; not the word itself
	10. Don't focus; Play 
	11. Let your stomach free; Not your chest
	12. 90% of your skill is in your mind; 10% of your skill is from practice
	13. Posture; Stand up straight; Don't squeeze your lungs
	14. 

	Additional Long-term tips
	1. Practice everyday
	2. Excerise your lungs
	3. Vocal warm ups
	4. Vocal strengthening
	5. Drink 4 cups of water everyday; Keep your vocal chords strong
